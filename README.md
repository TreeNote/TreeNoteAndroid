With TreeNote, you can create and structure notes and tasks.<br>
Drag the drag handle at the right side of an entry onto a second entry, to make the first entry a child of the second entry. <br>
Tap on an arrow to expand or collapse a parent entry.<br>
When you swipe an entry to the left, only its children will be shown. Swipe to the right anywhere, to get a level up again
Tap on an entry to open it's detail view. Here you can delete the entry or set it's type (note, todo, done), a start date, a camera image or a geoposition.<br>
Swipe from the left screen edge to the right, to open the navigation drawer. Here you find filters to show only entries with start date <= today, entries with a start date or tasks only.<br>
When the current date reaches the start date of an entry, you'll get a notification.<br>
In the settings, you can disable notifications and enable synchronisation with the desktop version of TreeNote.<br>
If you have a tabled, tilt the device to view the tree and the details of an entry side by side.
